# Fibonacci Number

LeetCode Q # 509.

The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

>F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
>F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.

Given n, calculate F(n).

Example 1:

>Input: n = 2</br>
>Output: 1</br>
>Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.</br>

Example 2:

>Input: n = 3</br>
>Output: 2</br>
>Explanation: F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.</br>

Example 3:

>Input: n = 4</br>
>Output: 3</br>
>Explanation: F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.</br>
